# Meta-analysis-programs
Bunch of different stuff; 
Power-macro is a SAS program for power calculations in meta-analysis. 
Schmidt2015 is an R program for individually corrected correlation coefficients. The calculations in this program follow those of Schmidt & Hunter's 2015 book.  The Schmidt2015 program also contains the 'Morris' method for correlations, and bootstrap confidence intervals for the lower bound of the credibility interval.

# Meta-analysis-programs
Bunch of different stuff; 
Several files refer to the metafor videos I made for youtube.  These begin with a number, e.g., 10_Mods.R.
Power-macro is a SAS program for power calculations in meta-analysis. 
Schmidt2015 is an R program for individually corrected correlation coefficients. The calculations in this program follow those of Schmidt & Hunter's 2015 book.  The Schmidt2015 program also contains the 'Morris' method for correlations, and bootstrap confidence intervals for the lower bound of the credibility interval.
